# Definitions
## Imperative vs Declarative
### Imperative
- Series of instructions
- Iterative functions
- Command driven, statement oriented
- Procedural
  - C
  - Pascal
  - Assembly
- Object oriented
  - C++
  - Java

### Declarative
- No side effects
- Focus on relations
- "What to get" instead of "How to get"
- Order of statements *shouldn't* matter
- Examples:
  - SQL
  - Prolog
  - Regex

## Scope vs Visibility
### Scope
- The set of expressions for which the variable *exists*
- In lexical scoping
  - variables in the scope we were *defined* in
  - and local variables
  - who uses this?
    - C-family languages
    - Scheme
    - Algol
- In dynamic scoping
  - variables in the scope we were *called* in
  - and local variables
  - who uses this?
    - early LISP
    - APL
    - BASH

### Visibility
- The set of expressions for which the variable *can be reached*
- If we **declare a local variable** with the *same name* as a variable in enclosing scope
  - that enclosing scope variable is now hidden
  - all references to *name* are to our locally scoped variable instead

## Applicative Order Evaluation vs Normal Order Evaluation
### Applicative Order Evaluation
- **Strict evaluation**
- Evaluate an expression *before* it is passed in as an argument
  - go as deep as you can until you hit primitives, then evaluate and go back
  - as deep into the nest as possible and work backwards

### Normal Order Evaluation
- **Lazy evaluation**
- Evaluate an expression *only* when its value is needed
  - first **expand**, then **reduce**
